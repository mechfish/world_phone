Things to accomplish before releasing this module:

* Remove the default dependence on wp_default files. Instead, build
  the default behaviors and country lists into the module and only use
  the countries/ directory for files which override the default
  behaviors.

* Change the plugin system. It occurs to me that Drupal has one
  already. And that the system I wrote for overriding the default
  behavior of phone fields could just as well use Drupal's hook
  system.

* One more review of main-module comments.

* Ascertain if we are really using the best possible method for
  theming the World Phone widget. Should we be including the
  Javascript in a different way? Ensure that the themer has many
  options for tinkering with the final display.
