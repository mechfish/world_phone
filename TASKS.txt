Things to accomplish before releasing this module:

* Remove the default dependence on wp_default files. Instead, build
  the default behaviors and country lists into the module and only use
  the countries/ directory for files which override the default
  behaviors.

* Remove the function which allows World Phone widgets to be used for
  text CCK fields. This is confusing, overcomplicated, and quite
  probably not useful.

* Comment all the code in the main module.

* Ascertain if we are really using the best possible method for
  theming the World Phone widget. Should we be including the
  Javascript in a different way? Ensure that the themer has many
  options for tinkering with the final display.
